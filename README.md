## Real-Time Sign Language Translator

### Introduction

Welcome to the Real-Time Sign Language Translator project. This tool is designed to enhance communication in classrooms by providing real-time sign language translations. It is particularly useful for educators, students, and speakers in inclusive settings where sign language interpretation is needed.

### Features

- **Real-Time Translation:** Leverages Hugging Face's speech-to-text transformer model to convert spoken words from teachers, students, and speakers into text.
- **AI Avatar:** Translates the text into corresponding sign language symbols and uses a realistic AI avatar to perform sign language in real-time.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides an easy-to-use interface for teachers and students to interact with the tool seamlessly.
- **Customization Options:** Allows customization of the avatar's appearance and signing style to suit individual preferences.

### Goals

- To bridge the communication gap between the hearing and deaf communities in educational environments.
- To provide an efficient and accurate real-time sign language translation tool.
- To foster an inclusive and supportive learning atmosphere for all students.
